Hi, I am Elie Ly-Kok, Welcome to this webpage dedicated to my 3D Animation skillsets. You will find a demoreel, you can browse through categories of content, and contact infos. I am definitely interested to hear from you about any opportunities related to the CG field, so feel free to drop me an email to share your projects, offers, or even just to talk about the CG industry. I am looking for works and collaborations in 3D animation, regardless of their worldwide location.
